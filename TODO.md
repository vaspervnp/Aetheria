# Aetheria — Development TODO

Autonomous build log & roadmap. Checked items are implemented **and** covered by
either the xUnit suite or the `--smoke` head-less simulation.

## Milestone 0 — Project scaffolding
- [x] `.NET 9` solution with Engine (lib) / Aetheria (exe) / Tests (xUnit)
- [x] Raylib-cs NuGet reference
- [x] README + TODO plan

## Milestone 1 — Testable core (no rendering)
- [x] Deterministic RNG (`Rng`) — xorshift, reproducible for tests
- [x] Value/Perlin noise (`Noise`) — seeded, bounded output
- [x] `Aabb` axis-aligned box + intersection / sweep helpers
- [x] `GameConfig` tunables (gravity, speeds, tile size…)
- [x] Input abstraction (`IInputSource`, `InputState`, scripted source)
- [x] `TileType` + `TileMap` (grid, solidity, world↔tile, collision queries)
- [x] `AbilitySet` progression / inventory
- [x] xUnit: RNG, noise bounds, AABB, tilemap, abilities

## Milestone 2 — Physics & player controller
- [x] `Entity` base (position, velocity, size, aabb)
- [x] `Player` (Spark): accel/friction, variable jump, gravity
- [x] Tile collision resolution (X then Y sweep, ground/ceiling/wall flags)
- [x] Coyote time + jump buffering
- [x] Abilities: Double Jump, Dash, Wall-slide/climb/jump, Phase
- [x] Health / energy, damage, invulnerability window
- [x] xUnit: jump apex, gravity fall, landing, dash displacement, gating

## Milestone 3 — World & rooms
- [x] `Room` (tilemap + spawns + doors + pickups + metadata)
- [x] `RoomGenerator` — deterministic, guaranteed-traversable layouts, organic
      cellular-automata decoration + noise texturing hints
- [x] `World` graph — current room, edge-door transitions, respawn
- [x] Ability-gated progression path to the Core
- [x] xUnit: generator invariants (bounds, spawn not in solid, has floor),
      world transition wiring, reachability of the Core

## Milestone 4 — Enemies & combat
- [x] `Enemy` base + patroller / flyer / guardian AI
- [x] Pulse attack + dash damage, projectiles
- [x] Contact damage to player, enemy death, hazards
- [x] xUnit: AI stays in bounds, damage/health resolution

## Milestone 5 — Procedural rendering
- [x] `Palette` + `TextureFactory` (player glow, enemies, tiles, particles)
- [x] Parallax procedural background (noise nebula + drifting motes)
- [x] `FollowCamera` clamped to room bounds, smoothing, screen-shake
- [x] Particle system (dash trail, impacts, ambient motes)
- [x] HUD (health, energy, ability icons, room name)

## Milestone 6 — Audio
- [x] `WavSynth` — procedural 16-bit PCM WAV (jump/dash/land/hit/pickup/…)
- [x] `AudioManager` — load from memory, play, volume
- [x] xUnit: WAV header validity + sample counts

## Milestone 7 — Game loop & polish
- [x] `Game` state machine (Title, Playing, Paused, GameOver, Victory)
- [x] `RaylibInput` real input source
- [x] `--smoke` head-less simulation harness (N frames, scripted input)
- [x] Title / victory / death screens, transitions, screen flash
- [x] Final integration build + full `dotnet test` green

## Backlog / possible future polish
- [ ] Save/load of unlocked abilities & last room
- [ ] Minimap overlay
- [ ] Additional zones, bosses, and a second guardian pattern
- [ ] Gamepad support via Raylib gamepad API
